title: Context Integrations

Most services are disrupted due to a chain reaction of various tests failing. Zenduty allows you to add "Context" integrations- those that will send information, but not create any incidents in your team. These can be integrations of other teams, monitoring tools or any other tools that will give your team information about your service. 

## Adding a Context Integration

1. Go to the team you want to add the context to, and click "view".

5. Make sure that the Zenduty webhooks are configured in the context integration. You can find steps to do so for any integration [here](Integrations.md).

## Getting Context for an Incident
