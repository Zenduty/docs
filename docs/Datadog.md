Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services. To integrate Datadog with Zenduty, complete the following steps:

2. Next, go to "Services" and click on the "Manage" button corresponding to the relevant Service.
3. Go to "Integrations" and then "Add New Integration". Give it a name and select the application "Datadog" from the dropdown menu.
4. Go to "Configure" under your integrations and copy the webhooks URL generated. 

## In Datadog: 

5. Login to Datadog. From the left hand menu, go to Integrations-> Integrations. Search for "Webhooks" from this page, and click the corresponding button.

6. Scroll down, fill in the name, url (copied above) and custom payload. **Check the "Use Custom Payload" box**.
Paste this in the custom payload box:

		"hostname":"$HOSTNAME",
		"date_posix":"$DATE_POSIX",
		"aggreg_key":"$AGGREG_KEY",

		"alert_status":"$ALERT_STATUS",
