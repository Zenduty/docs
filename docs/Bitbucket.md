Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems.

With the Zenduty integration, you will be able to receive context notifications about new code pushes, pull requests, issues and issue comments. New issues will trigger a new incident.
