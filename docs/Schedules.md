There are 3 parts that are key in configuring a schedule:

1. Participants for the schedule
2. Rotation period for shifts
3. Start and End date and time


## Creating a new Schedule for a team

## Selecting Participants
 
Schedules are associated with teams in Zenduty. A schedule can be given to selected users within the team.

## Defining Rotation
Rotation can be daily, weekly or custom. Daily rotation means participants will rotate every 24 hours from specified starting date and time. 
Rotations can be restricted to certain days and times of the week. Limiting the time frame of the rotations allows defining different on-call rotations at different time periods, such as working hours, off hours, and weekends. Rotations are cumulative. If the time frames for rotations overlap, all the rotations apply, hence there may be multiple participants assigned to be on-call at the same time.
