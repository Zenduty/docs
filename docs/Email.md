FAQ

Q: I am trying to send an email to the given email address, but it's not creating an incident:
A: Possible reasons for this to happen:
a) The email being sent does not contain the integration email address in the "To" section.
b) The email is sent to a group email address and not to the Zenduty email address individually
c) The email source is unverified. Make sure that the email is being sent by a genuine mail server and a verified mail account.
