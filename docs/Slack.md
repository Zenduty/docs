Slack is a popular workplace messaging platform, designed to get tools, people and context together so teams can troubleshoot faster. The Zenduty Incident Management platform fetches alerts from your monitoring apps, creates and assigns incidents based on schedules and escalation policies and intimates engineers on call. When these two applications come together, the result is a fast, stress-free incident-resolution process.
