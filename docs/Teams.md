## What are Teams on Zenduty?
Most IT organizations are divided into different operational units. Zenduty helps organizations to replicate this structure in their incident management goals.

Each team consists of its own [services](Services.md). Each service within a team has it's own [Escalation Policies](EscalationPolicies.md) goverened by a set of [schedules](Schedules.md) and [users](Users.md).

## Why are Teams useful?
Since each team has it's own set of [services](Services.md) and [users](Users.md), operations by them can be authorized and managed independently. 

## Find your teams
