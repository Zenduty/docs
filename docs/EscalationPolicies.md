Each [service](Services.md) in a Zenduty [team](Teams.md) is governed by an Escalation Policy. This Escalation policy combines various [schedules](Schedules.md) and tasks to be performed for the [users](Users.md) in the team as a set of rules. When an incident is triggered in the service, alerts are triggered according to the Escalation Policy specified. 

To view Escalation Policies of a Team, simply click the "Manage" button corresponding to the Team. On the secondary header, select the tab "Escalation Policies"
