For advanced post-mortems, Zenduty has an inbuilt "analytics" dashboard. This feature allows you to get deep insight into performance by account, teams, users or services. You can select custom ranges to track and anaylize activities for every segment. 
Analytics gives you count of Total Incidents, Average MTTA (Mean Team To Acknowledge) and Average MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) over the time frame and granuality you select.
